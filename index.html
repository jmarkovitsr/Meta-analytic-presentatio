# Summary 


-  The goal  of the present work is to inform about the overall empirical value of artificial phonology for the understanding of putative language learning mechanisms in infancy  covering distributional learning.

- To address this goal the author apply meta-analytic tools to the body of infant artificial phonology studies in order to describe  the analysis in three ways:
1. weighted mean effect size
2. if certain factors are moderator (third variable that affect the strenght between the dependent and the independent variable) of overall effect size.
3. selective reporting in the literature via inspection of funnel plots

#Two theoretical proposals of infant language-learning at phonology level


.pull-left[ K.E Chambers et al. (2003): phonotactic learning 
- Infants can track the frequency with wich sounds occurr in a given syllabic position.
- Participants heard CVC syllables (set 1: /b, k, n,
f/; set 2: /p, g, m, s/) 
- /bæp/: familiarization 
- /bIp/:(legal) 
- /pæb/ :(illegal)  ]

.pull-right[ Maye et al. (2002): distributional learning 
- Infants track the distribution of acoustic cues in the input as modes or peaks along an acoustic dimension.
- Participants listen a nonnative speech sound distributions, a continuum [da] and [ta], to test  whether infants revealed phonetic learning.

# Methdology employed 

Meta-analytic approach


## 2.1 Paper identification 
- the paper pool was composed by a list of papers known to the author with systematic searches on pubmed and google.scholar


##2.2 Paper selection

.pull-left[near conceptual replications of the seminal study by K.E. Chambers et al.(2003)]
.pull-right[near- replications of the seminal study by Maye et al. (2002)]

###Criteria
- participants: 0 and 36 months
- exposure and tested in a lab
- exposure to word-like item followed by new word-like item that follow or violate that restriction

## 2.3 Data entry

 Each study was coded in terms of:
- backgroung information of the paper
- average age of the infants
- number of infants
- type of test trial contrasted (e.g comparing to illegal versus familiar trial; or comparing  illegal versus legal)
- mean and sd of looking times for each trial
- the correlation in individuals looking times across the two trial types within each experiment

## 2.4 Effect size calculation
- using the coded information, an effect size, the SD of the effect size, and a weighting factor were calculate for each experiment. For the present meta-analysis, the dependent measure was looking time to two type of trials (familiar versus legal; legal versus ilegal)

# 3. Analyses
- All analyses have been carried out with R. The author used the metafor package (Viechtbauer, 2010). Three questions were addressed:
1. The main effects
2. the importance of certain moderators
3. Presence of bias 

##Meta-analytic tools
1. A random meta- analytic regression: the overall strenght of the effects of laboratory phonological learning
2. A second random meta-analytic regression: to analyze variance in results 
3. Analyze the distribution of p-values

# Results

- the overall effect size was very close to zero
- proposed moderators did not significantly account for variance
- there was weak evidence of bias in the literature

---

# Conclusion

- The author found no systematic evidence that infant s phonotactic learning can be experimentally induced in the laboratory.
- This results may indicate that the field has not yet found a way to reproduce learning of sound patterns in a controlled setting.

- Future research in phonotactic and distributional sound learning in infancy should study under what experimental conditions robust and replicable effects can be obtained.

- Code?

  
  - Yes, Analyses  - [link](https://osf.io/bcjhs/)
  
- Reproducible document?

--
    - Yes, if you know a lot of statistic you can do it

# 
# Are you able to reproduce the statistical analyses? Are your results the same as the results in the manuscript?
- There are explanations in the code as to what to do, however it requires more statitic knowledge

# Is the software used to analyze the data open source?

- Yes, they used R

---

# Can you run the code without errors?

- No

--

# Are you able to reproduce the plots and tables?

- No. I downloaded metafor package, 


# What other materials are available? 

- Preprint on-line  - [link](https://osf.io/jffa5/)

# Using a scale from 1 to 10, give the article an open science score. 

- 7

---
# Justify your evaluation

- The material on line gives you a general idea how to undertake a meta-analyses

- Data is available and code used is available, but if you are a novice R user, it is difficult withouth further explanation

- some of the data seems to be there without any justifications and some data is missing
